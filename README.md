# README - Axure RP9 Calculator App

## Overview
This is a functional calculator prototype built with Axure RP9 that performs basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (×)
- Division (÷)

## Features
- Clean, intuitive interface mimicking a standard calculator
- Four basic arithmetic operations
- Clear (C) button to reset calculations
- Equals (=) button to compute results
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes

## How to Use
1. Open the prototype in Axure RP9 or view in a web browser
2. Click number buttons to input values
3. Select an operation button (+, -, ×, ÷)
4. Enter the second number
5. Press "=" to see the result
6. Use "C" to clear the current calculation

## Interactions
- Button presses show visual feedback
- Sequential calculations supported
- Error handling for division by zero
- Display shows current input and results

## Requirements
- Axure RP9 to edit the prototype
- Web browser to view the published prototype

## Files Included
- `calculator.rp` (Axure RP9 project file)
- `calculator.html` (Published prototype)
- `/resources` (Any supporting assets)

## Notes
- This is a prototype demonstrating Axure's interactive capabilities
- For actual implementation, code would need to be developed separately
